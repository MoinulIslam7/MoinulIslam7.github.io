  description: "I'm Moinul Islam, a passionate software engineer with 3 years of experience in building web applications. I specialize in turning coffee into code and occasionally solving actual problems. My current stack includes React, Next.js, Node.js, and MongoDB, but I'm always learning new ways to break (and then fix) things. When I'm not coding, you'll find me debugging my life choices or explaining to non-tech friends that 'the cloud' is just someone else's computer.",
